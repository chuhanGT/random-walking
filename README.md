Fortran---random-walk-of-ions-by-using-Monte-Carlo-method
=========================================================
This fortran code is aimed to calculate the equilibrium state of a huge number of dopant ions 
moving in side the bulk or on the surface of a kind of perovskite, BaZrO3. With the formation 
energies known, Monte Carlo method can be applied to this problem.

A input file is given, and you can modify it as you want.
